      q: "Our doctor will tell us when it's time.",
      a: "That's wonderful that you have such a strong trust in your doctor; that relationship is so important. To support that, we can act as an extra set of eyes and ears at home and share our observations with your doctor. This can help them have the full picture during your next conversation.",
    },
    {
      q: "We feel that hospice means giving up hope.",
      a: "Thank you for sharing that; it's one of the most common and understandable concerns we hear. Hospice is not about giving up hope, but about redefining it. We focus hope on new goals: hope for comfort, hope for meaningful moments with family, and hope for living each day to its fullest, right at home.",

      q: "The patient is still seeking curative treatment.",
      a: "It's so important to honor that desire for continued treatment, and we fully support it. Hospice can actually work alongside certain palliative treatments. Our goal isn't to replace care, but to add a layer of expert symptom management that can make those treatments more tolerable and improve quality of life.",

      q: "We have a preferred hospice we already work with.",

If you ever have a patient or family who might benefit from a different approach, or if your preferred partner has a full caseload, we'd be honored to be your second call.",
    },
    {
      q: "Hospice is too expensive.",
      a: "That is a very practical and important concern. Many people are surprised to learn that hospice is a fully covered benefit under Medicare, Medicaid, and most private insurances. This means there are typically no out-of-pocket costs for the patient or family for any care related to the hospice diagnosis.",
    },
    {
      q: "We can manage the patient's symptoms ourselves.",
      a: "The dedication of your team is incredible, and you do amazing work. Think of us as specialists you can call on, just like a cardiologist or a pulmonologist. Our team is specifically trained in complex end-of-life symptom management, and we're available 24/7. We're here to support you, not replace you.",
    },
    {
      q: "We want to do everything we can.",
      a: "I hear you, and that desire to provide the best possible care is so important. Hospice is not about doing less; it's about doing everything we can to ensure comfort and quality of life. We're adding a specialized layer of support focused entirely on managing symptoms and providing peace, right where the patient is most comfortable.",
