      "The patient must have a DNR order on file",
      "The attending physician must refer the patient in writing",
      "Two physicians must certify a life expectancy of six months or less if the disease runs its normal course",
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation: "Medicare requires certification by the patient's attending physician and the hospice medical director that the patient has a terminal prognosis of six months or less. A DNR and written referral are not eligibility requirements.",

      "Signing a Do Not Resuscitate order",
      "Transferring their primary care to the hospice medical director",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Electing the hospice benefit means the patient chooses comfort-focused care and foregoes curative treatment for the terminal diagnosis. They can still receive treatment for unrelated conditions. A DNR is not required.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    category: "Eligibility",
    question: "What are the four levels of hospice care under the Medicare Hospice Benefit?",
    options: [
      "Basic Care, Advanced Care, Crisis Care, Terminal Care",
      "Routine Home Care, Continuous Home Care, General Inpatient Care, Inpatient Respite",
      "Home Care, Skilled Nursing, Inpatient, Palliative",
      "Level 1 through Level 4, as defined by the patient's hospice team",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Medicare defines four levels: Routine Home Care (standard daily care at home), Continuous Home Care (crisis periods requiring nursing 8 or more hours per day), General Inpatient Care (unmanageable symptoms requiring hospital-level care), and Inpatient Respite (short-term relief for caregivers).",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    category: "Clinical Terms",
    question: "What is the key distinction between palliative care and hospice?",
    options: [
      "There is no meaningful distinction, the terms are interchangeable",
      "Palliative care focuses on comfort but can be provided alongside curative treatment at any stage; hospice requires forgoing curative treatment",
      "Palliative care is only for cancer patients; hospice is for all terminal diagnoses",
      "Hospice is administered only in a facility; palliative care can happen at home",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Palliative care is a broader approach to symptom management and quality of life that can accompany curative treatment at any disease stage. Hospice is a specific Medicare benefit requiring election, prognosis certification, and a shift away from curative treatment for the terminal diagnosis.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    category: "Clinical Terms",

      "Advanced Disease Limitations: used to describe late-stage illness severity",
      "Admission and Discharge Logistics: the process for transitioning a patient",
      "Attending Doctor Liaison: the contact person at a referring facility",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Activities of Daily Living (bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, eating) are closely tracked in eligibility documentation. Measurable decline in ADLs, especially when combined with weight loss and reduced oral intake, supports the clinical picture of a six-month prognosis.",

    id: 6,
    category: "Clinical Terms",
    question: "Which of the following best describes the role of the hospice Interdisciplinary Team (IDT)?",
    options: [
      "The administrative staff at the hospice agency responsible for scheduling",
      "A group of physicians who certify patient eligibility every 90 days",
      "A billing and compliance committee that reviews Medicare documentation",
      "A team including nurses, social workers, chaplains, aides, and the medical director who collaborate on the patient's plan of care",
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation: "The IDT is a core component of hospice care. It typically includes RNs, CNAs, social workers, chaplains, and the medical director, all working together on each patient's individualized plan of care. Understanding the IDT helps reps explain the depth of hospice support to referral sources.",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    category: "Objection Handling",
    question: "A discharge planner tells you: 'We already have a hospice we work with.' What is the best first response?",
    options: [
      "Offer a lower cost or faster admission turnaround to compete directly",
      "Acknowledge the relationship and immediately leave, planning to return repeatedly until they change their mind",
      "Challenge them by pointing out that patient choice requires offering multiple options",
      "Ask how that relationship is working and what would make referring to a second provider worth considering",
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation: "The goal is not to replace their current provider but to earn the right to be an option. Asking how the relationship is working opens a genuine conversation. Competing on price devalues your offering, and invoking patient choice as a challenge creates defensiveness rather than partnership.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    category: "Objection Handling",
    question: "A family member says: 'I feel like enrolling in hospice means we're giving up on my father.' How should you respond?",
    options: [
      "Agree that it is a hard decision, then explain that hospice often extends quality and sometimes length of life by focusing on comfort and whole-person care",
      "Reassure them that hospice is not giving up, then quickly move on to the paperwork",
      "Explain the Medicare eligibility criteria to show the decision is medically appropriate",
      "Tell them that their physician already made this recommendation, so it is the right path",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Families need to feel heard before they can receive information. Validating the emotion, then reframing hospice as an active and caring choice rather than abandonment, is the approach that builds trust. Leading with paperwork or deferring to physician authority bypasses the emotional core of the objection.",
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    category: "Objection Handling",
    question: "A physician says: 'My patient isn't ready for hospice yet.' What is the most effective response?",
    options: [
      "Provide the eligibility criteria in writing and ask them to reconsider",
      "Suggest the family request hospice evaluation directly to work around the physician",
      "Respect the physician's judgment and follow up in two weeks",
      "Ask the physician what 'ready' looks like clinically and explore whether the current trajectory already meets criteria",
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation: "A physician's 'not yet' often signals uncertainty rather than a hard no. Asking what 'ready' looks like creates a collaborative clinical conversation. Handing over paperwork can feel dismissive. Going around the physician damages the relationship and the patient's continuity of care.",
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    category: "Objection Handling",
    question: "Which of the following is the most common reason hospice reps lose referrals after they are made?",
    options: [
      "The patient or family changes their mind about hospice",
      "The hospice medical director declines the patient",
      "Slow response time, where the referral source perceives the hospice as unreliable",
      "The competition offers a faster admission process",
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Speed to contact and responsiveness are the most frequently cited reasons referral sources switch or diversify providers. A referral source who feels ignored or left waiting will stop calling. Admission response time is a key metric that directly drives referral loyalty.",
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    category: "Territory Strategy",
    question: "What defines an A-tier account in a hospice sales territory?",
    options: [
      "Accounts where you have a strong personal relationship with the director",
      "Any account that has made at least one referral in the past six months",
      "Large facilities with more than 100 beds, regardless of referral history",
      "Accounts with high referral volume or high growth potential that justify the most consistent visit frequency",
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation: "A-tier accounts are defined by referral output and growth potential, not simply by size or existing relationships. These accounts receive the highest visit frequency (often weekly) and the most tailored engagement strategy. Relationship quality is a result of consistent execution, not the basis for tiering.",
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    category: "Territory Strategy",
    question: "A hospice rep has 90 accounts and 20 working days per month. What is the most important first step in managing this territory effectively?",
    options: [
      "Focus exclusively on the top 10 accounts and ignore the rest until referrals increase",
      "Build a spreadsheet of all contacts and call them on a rotating basis",
      "Segment accounts by tier (A, B, C) and assign visit frequency based on tier rather than equal distribution",
      "Visit every account at least once per month to maintain visibility",
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Attempting to visit 90 accounts equally across 20 days is not executable. Tiered segmentation allows you to concentrate your highest-value time on the accounts most likely to produce referrals, while maintaining lighter touch with B and C accounts. Equal distribution dilutes impact across the territory.",
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    category: "Territory Strategy",
    question: "What is the primary purpose of a pre-call plan before visiting a referral source?",
    options: [
      "To document the visit in the CRM before it happens",
      "To review the facility's census to see if any patients may be eligible",
      "To identify a specific, relevant objective for the visit so the conversation adds value instead of just checking in",
      "To prepare a list of talking points about the hospice's services and differentiators",
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "A pre-call plan centers on your objective for that specific visit and that specific person. Referral sources can tell the difference between a rep who came to check in and one who came to solve something or bring something useful. Consistent value delivery is what earns trust over time.",
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    category: "Physician Engagement",
    question: "When approaching a physician office for the first time, what should your initial goal be?",
    options: [
      "Earn a brief, focused meeting with the physician or NP to understand how they currently handle hospice conversations",
      "Secure a referral commitment from the attending physician",
      "Leave educational materials with the front desk and request a follow-up",
      "Present your hospice's outcomes data and admission response times",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "The first visit is about understanding, not pitching. Physicians respond to reps who listen and ask smart questions. Your goal is to learn how they think about hospice, what hesitations they have, and what would make them comfortable referring. That insight shapes every subsequent interaction.",
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    category: "Physician Engagement",
    question: "A physician tells you they hesitate to refer because 'patients feel abandoned when I move them to hospice.' What does this tell you about how to engage this physician?",
    options: [
      "You should bring a hospice nurse to the next visit to explain the clinical model",
      "This physician needs education on Medicare eligibility criteria",
      "This physician has a relationship-driven concern about continuity of care and needs reassurance that hospice supports rather than replaces the physician relationship",
      "This physician is not a viable referral source and their mindset is unlikely to change",
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "A physician who says patients feel 'abandoned' is telling you their core concern is the ongoing care relationship. The right response is to explain how hospice supports the physician through IDT updates, symptom management that reduces hospitalizations, and family support, rather than leading with eligibility data.",
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    category: "Follow-Up",
    question: "What is the key difference between a value-add follow-up and a check-in call?",
    options: [
      "A check-in is reserved for existing referral relationships; a value-add is for prospecting",
      "There is no meaningful difference; both accomplish the same goal",
      "A value-add follow-up is longer and more formal; a check-in is a quick call",
      "A value-add follow-up brings something relevant and useful to the referral source; a check-in is contact for the sake of contact",
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation: "Check-ins ('just wanted to see how things are going') add no value and train referral sources to ignore your calls. Value-add follow-ups bring something specific such as an article, an eligibility update, a solved problem, or a relevant case insight. Over time, value-add contacts build the kind of trust that translates to referrals.",
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    category: "Follow-Up",
    question: "Research shows that most hospice reps give up on a prospect after how many contacts?",
    options: [
      "5 to 6 contacts",
      "10 or more contacts",
      "2 to 3 contacts",
      "1 to 2 contacts",
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Most reps give up after 2 to 3 contacts, while research consistently shows that meaningful relationships in healthcare sales require 7 to 12 touches before a referral pattern develops. Persistence combined with genuine value separates reps who build territories from those who plateau.",
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    category: "Compliance & Ethics",
    question: "The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits hospice reps from doing which of the following?",
    options: [
      "Leaving printed materials at a facility without prior approval from the administrator",
      "Discussing hospice eligibility criteria with physicians who have not asked",
      "Meeting with discharge planners more than once per week",
      "Offering gifts, meals, or remuneration to referral sources in exchange for patient referrals",
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation: "The Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b) makes it a federal crime to offer anything of value to induce or reward referrals for Medicare-covered services. This applies to meals, gifts, event tickets, and any other remuneration. Frequency of visits and educational discussions are not covered under this statute.",
  },
  {
    id: 19,
    category: "Compliance & Ethics",
    question: "Under HIPAA, a hospice rep discussing a specific patient's clinical condition with a discharge planner at the referring facility is:",
    options: [
      "Always a HIPAA violation, since the rep is not a clinical employee",
      "Generally permissible for treatment coordination purposes, sharing minimum necessary information to facilitate care",
      "Not regulated by HIPAA since the discharge planner already has the patient's information",
      "Permissible only if the patient has signed a specific HIPAA release form for that conversation",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "HIPAA permits sharing of protected health information for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations without a separate authorization. Care coordination between a referring facility and a hospice provider falls under the treatment exception. Minimum necessary information should guide what is shared.",
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    category: "Sales Methodology",
    question: "Which of the following best describes the Spartan approach to hospice sales?",
    options: [
      "Volume-based cold calling with a focus on reach and frequency",
      "Patient advocacy that positions the rep as a clinical resource rather than a salesperson",
      "Relationship-first engagement built on consistent accountability, ethical messaging, and measurable weekly execution",
      "Digital-first outreach using LinkedIn and email to reduce time spent in the field",
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "The Spartan method is grounded in consistent, accountable field execution rather than volume alone. It combines relationship-building with territory discipline, ethical clinical conversations, and weekly performance metrics. The goal is a system that produces predictable referral growth, not sporadic wins.",
