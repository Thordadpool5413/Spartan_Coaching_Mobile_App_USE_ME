        problem: "Most hospice providers lose eligible patients because of slow response times. When a referral comes in on Monday but the patient isn't contacted until Wednesday, families find another provider or the clinical window closes. The problem isn't laziness. It is unclear ownership, clunky handoffs between sales and intake, and no forcing mechanism to move fast.",
        impact: "Every day of delay reduces conversion rates and shortens average length of stay. Patients who could benefit from 60+ days of hospice care end up with 14 days or less. This isn't just lost revenue. It is lost opportunity to serve families during the hardest moments of their lives."
