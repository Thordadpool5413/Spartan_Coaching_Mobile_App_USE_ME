              Spartan Coaching was born in the field. We built teams, ran routes, and sat with clinicians.

We kept what worked and cut the rest.

In practice, this looks like a liaison who knows exactly which accounts to visit on Tuesday, what questions to ask, and how to measure success.

                  At the heart of hospice sales is human connection. Empathy is about listening with intent, understanding the unspoken needs of providers and families, and building trust that goes beyond any single referral. We train you to connect authentically, ask better questions, and position hospice not as a product, but as a partner in delivering comfort and dignity. This means understanding that a case manager at 2pm on Friday has different needs than a physician at 8am Monday morning.

              This model is built for hospice providers who want referrals to be consistent, appropriate, and repeatable inside an account. Not because someone is "great with people," but because the referral source has a clear path, clear expectations, and a clear reason to call you when the right patient shows up.

                Hospice referrals do not break because the account does not care. They break because the process is unclear. The triggers are fuzzy. The conversation feels risky. The workflow feels like extra work. This model removes that friction by giving your team a simple, coachable process that works across different roles, different personalities, and different levels of account engagement.
              </p>
              <p className="text-body text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                The model is structured into four subjects. Each subject has a purpose, an execution standard, and a measurable output. We run them in sequence every time, because skipping steps is how you end up "checking in" for six months and calling it relationship building.
