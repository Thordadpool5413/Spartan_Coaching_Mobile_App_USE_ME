# Spartan Coaching - Hospice Sales Consulting Platform

## Overview

Spartan Coaching is a hospice sales consulting firm's web platform designed to improve hospice sales effectiveness. It offers a public-facing marketing site and expert tools for generating sales playbooks, handling objections, conducting research, and transcribing audio. The platform aims to help hospice sales professionals get eligible patients into care earlier through practical, expert-driven coaching and consulting, focusing on patient outcomes and elite sales performance. Note: Spartan Coaching is a consulting business, NOT an AI company — AI is used as a supporting tool, not the core identity.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions

The platform features a premium SaaS aesthetic with a sophisticated visual design system. Key elements include: Inter font family typography, a refined color palette with a vibrant red primary accent, layered gradients, glassmorphism, smooth animations, and a hierarchical shadow system for depth. It adheres to a mobile-first responsive design, ensuring optimal experience across all devices. Content presentation focuses on clear problem/solution/outcome narratives with enhanced testimonials, and LinkedIn integration is included for professional networking.

### Technical Implementations

- **Frontend**: Built with React 19 and TypeScript, using Wouter for routing, Vite as the build tool, and Shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS for styling. TanStack Query manages server state.
- **Backend**: Implemented with Express.js in TypeScript with an ESM module system, featuring middleware-based request handling and Zod schemas for validation.
- **Data Storage**: Uses Neon serverless PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for persistent data, including a migration system. LocalStorage is used for client-side preferences.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o via Replit AI Integrations (`AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_BASE_URL` + `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_API_KEY`). All 7 functions in `server/openai.ts`: complex responses (gpt-4o), quick responses (gpt-4o-mini), research, drills, chatbot, roleplay response, and roleplay feedback. `server/gemini.ts` kept as deprecated backup. Client is created fresh per call (no caching, tokens expire).

Uses `site_settings` table (key-value store) via `GET /api/site-settings` (public) and `PATCH /api/admin/site-settings` (admin).
- **Candidate Assessment Tool**: Structured hiring assessment system for evaluating hospice sales rep candidates. Admins create named assessments with quiz (multiple choice) and scenario (written response) questions via the admin panel Assessments tab, then share a public link (`/assessment/:id`). Candidates enter name/email, complete all questions, and receive instant scoring. Quiz questions scored for accuracy; scenario responses evaluated by AI (OpenAI GPT-4.1) for hospice sales aptitude. Composite score displayed to candidates immediately. Admin results dashboard shows all submissions with scores, candidate info, and expandable AI feedback per candidate. Confirmation email sent to candidates via Resend with score summary. **Invite links**: Admins can send personalized assessment invites from the admin panel — enters candidate name+email, system generates a unique token URL (`/assessment/:id?token=UUID`), sends branded invite email via Resend, and pre-fills candidate info on the assessment page (read-only fields). Invites tracked with sent/used status; token marked used on submission. Admin sees invite list with pending/completed badges and copy-link buttons. **Branded assessment URLs**: Admins create client organizations with custom slugs, optional logo URL, and accent color. Each client maps to an assessment and gets a branded URL at `/assess/:slug` (e.g., `/assess/acme-hospice`). The branded page shows client logo, company name, and "Powered by Spartan Coaching" footer. Submissions from branded URLs include the `clientSlug` for tracking. If a slug is not found, visitors redirect to the default assessment. Admin manages clients in the Assessments tab "Branded Assessment URLs" section. Database tables: `assessments`, `assessment_questions`, `assessment_submissions` (with `clientSlug` column), `assessment_invites`, `assessment_clients`.
